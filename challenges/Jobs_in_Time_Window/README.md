# Inspecting Jobs

Developing large, parallel, scalable applications is arguably the most demanding effort that end-users of HPC systems like Summit face. However, once an application is ready for production runs, a strong understanding of and familiarity with the user environment can be just as critical for a team to be productive.

The user environment includes interfaces to the batch scheduler, parallel job laucher, structure of available file systems, along with any user-configurable parts of the system. This challenge will rely on interaction with Summit's batch scheduler, [IBM Spectrum LSF](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_welcome.html).

## Monitoring jobs with LSF

As you may have already seen in [Basic_Workflow](../Basic_Workflow), LSF provides the fundamental mechanisms to [submit batch jobs](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#batch-scripts), [monitor their status](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#monitoring-jobs) after they've been enqueued, and [control them if needed](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html#interacting-with-jobs). 

We won't be submitting any new jobs here, but rather looking at others that have already been run and gathering information about them. To do this, we'll primarily use the `bhist` command. 

(See the `bhist` manual page by running `man bhist` for a full list of command options.)

## Let's try to answer...
1. How many jobs were completed on Summit between 00:00 (midnight) on June 1, 2022 and 23:59 on June 15, 2022?

2. How many unique users did the jobs from question 1 belong to?

### BONUS!
3. Of the jobs found in question 1, what's the job ID of the longest running job?
    1. How long was it pending (pre-execution), and how long did it run (actual execution time)?
    2. When was it submitted?
